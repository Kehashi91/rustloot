Rust CLI utility for loot tables.

To be used on my Postapocalyptic RPG sessions to get random loot from scavenging. Given a biome, and a dice roll value (that defines how lucky the players were) should return a list of found items. 

While I first want to make it work with hardcoded data that suits my play, i will consider a more generic approach (loading loot tables from files).
