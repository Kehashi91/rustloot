Rust CLI utility for loot tables.

To be used on my Postapocalyptic RPG sessions to get random loot from scavenging. Given a biome, and a dice roll value (that defines how lucky the players were) should return a list of found items. 

todo:
- implement customizable loottable definitions (as YAML configs?)
- add CLI ui
- add filters and complexity to loottables
